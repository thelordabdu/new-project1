"""Unified webhook router – delegates incoming requests to provider strategies.

Route: ``/providers/{provider}/webhooks``

This router is the single entry point for all provider webhook events.
It resolves the provider strategy via ``ProviderFactory``, checks that the
provider has a ``BaseWebhookHandler`` wired up, and delegates to:

* ``strategy.webhooks.handle(request, body, db)``   – POST (data events)
* ``strategy.webhooks.handle_challenge(request)``   – GET (subscription verification)

The per-provider webhook handlers (to be implemented under
``app/services/providers/{provider}/webhook_handler.py``) are responsible for:

1. Verifying the request signature / token.
2. Parsing and validating the payload schema.
3. Dispatching to the appropriate service method.

Existing provider-specific routes (``/garmin/webhooks``, ``/oura/webhooks``,
``/strava/webhooks``) are intentionally kept in place while individual handlers
are migrated.  Once a provider's ``BaseWebhookHandler`` is implemented and wired
into its strategy, traffic can be cut over to this router.
