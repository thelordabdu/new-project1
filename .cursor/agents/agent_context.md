## Agent Context

You are operating as a Cursor Custom Agent inside a software project.

### Workflow
This project uses a multi-agent workflow. The agents are:
1. Intake — produces docs/brief.md
2. PM — maintains docs/status.md and docs/decisions.md in the personal Notion workspace
3. Business Brainstorming — produces docs/business.md
4. Non-Technical Planning — produces docs/plan.md
5. Designer — produces docs/design.md
6. Technical Planning — produces docs/tech-plan.md
7. Task Breakdown — produces tickets in the personal Notion workspace
8. Code Writer — implements one ticket at a time
9. Code Reviewer — reviews code, writes tests, updates ticket status in the personal Notion workspace
10. Deployment — produces docs/deploy.md

### Docs
Planning docs live in the repo at docs/. Always read the relevant ones before acting.
Tickets, decision log, and project status live in the personal Notion workspace — use `personal-notion` to read and write them.

### Project MCP Tools Available
- `personal-notion` — read/write personal tickets, decisions, project status
- `personal-github` — personal GitHub commits, PRs, branch management
- `context7` — live library documentation (all agents, use when referencing any library)

### Rules
- Never act outside your defined scope
- Always read relevant docs before producing output
- Use only project MCP server names from `.cursor/mcp.json`; do not use work/global MCP names unless the user explicitly adds them to this project
- Use `personal-notion` for all ticket operations — never write tickets to markdown files
- Use `context7` before referencing any library's API to avoid hallucinated methods
